## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment

This assignment takes inspiration from the game "Risk of Rain 2"
The song chosen for the visualiser is also from the game.
The visuals will include elements of outer space, space travel and an alien world.

# How it works

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Calvin: I am proud of my implementation of the features which use sin and cos.
My ring function uses sin, cos and the audio buffer to evenly space out each point around the sphere.
The camera movement also uses sin and cos to rotate around the center sphere.
Figuring out circular movement in 3D space was *very* tricky but alas i persevered.

Jello: I am most proud of my creation of terrain, implementing features that use noise and mapping.
My terrain function moves based on both Audio and x offset movement
Secondly I am most proud of my little space invader type movement giving more depth into the scene.
I am proud of including the very easy but scary looking alien that teleports every second multiple times.


Franz: Personally, I take the most pride in learning how to use 3d modelling software to create the
OBJ files for my scene. Although the softwares (paint 3d + 3d builder) were basic in nature, it is
an area that I have never had experience in and this project allowed me to venture out of my comfort zone.
I am also proud of orchestrating the scene as it did have to go through several iterations beforehand.
Learning how to use the camera in ways such as screen-shake were fun to learn and were worth the work.

Jason: I'm most proud of the way that I brought my creative vision to life. When we came up with the idea to do a ROR2 
themed project, the first thing I wanted to do was to create the scene where the planet explodes at the end of 
the game because I knew it was going to be cool. I knew it was going to be difficult to do, but I stuck with the 
idea and it all came together in the end. I'm also happy with how I handled the problem solving side of this assignment. 
I ran into a few issues such as low frame rates and scaling on different screen sizes. I was able to resolve these issues by 
optimizing my code and solving inefficiencies.
